# ETL- Extract, Transform, Load

## Overview of Analysis

### Deliverable 1: To refactor code and write a new function that will read data from three sources (``wikipedia-movies.json``, ``movies_ metadata.csv``, ``ratings.csv``) and create three seperate Pandas DataFrames for each dataset. 

### Deliverable 2: To merge Wikipedia data with Kaggle metadata while extracting ``IMDB IDs`` with regular expressions and using a ``try-except`` block to register and note potential errors. 

### Deliverable 3: To extract and refactor Kaggle metadata and Movies Lens rating data into seperate seperate DataFrames. Then merge the Kaggle metadata with the Wikipedia movie dataframe to create the the ``movies_df``, before finally combining said ``movies_df`` with Movies Lens data to create ``movies_wth_ratings_df``.

### Deliverable 4: To import ``movies_df`` and ``ratings.csv`` into a SQL Database.
